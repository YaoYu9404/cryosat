README.txt

DESCRIPTION:

The enclosed routines read standard Cryosat FBR/L1b/L2I/L2 .DBL files in SAR/SARIN/LRM Mode 
Use: 
     - the routine Cryo_L1b_read.m to read FBR/L1b CRYOSAT-2 Data Products
     - the routine Cryo_L2I_read.m to read L2I CRYOSAT-2 Data Products 
     - the routine Cryo_L2_read.m to read  L2 CRYOSAT-2 Data Products 

The routines work also with FDM Data Products

USAGE:

In order to use the routines, pass in input as function argument and as string the full filename (path + file) where the CryoSat .DBL
file is stored in your local drive
The routine returns in output a structure <HDR>, containing the header of the read file, and the structure <CS>, containing the read data fields 

Cryo_L1b_read.m: 
Reads Cryosat-2 FBR and L1b products(LRM SAR SARin mode) located in the local drive. 

Cryo_L2I_read.m: 
Reads Cryosat-2 L2I products (LRM SAR SARin mode) located in the local drive. 

Cryo_L2_read.m: 
Reads Cryosat-2 L2 products (LRM SAR SARin mode) located in the local drive.
